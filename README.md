# Getting Started with Feedback App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run server`

Runs the JSON-Server mock backend. This is requred for the frontend to work properly. Run this command in a separate terminal window.

## Admin Console

Before submitted feedback will be displayed in the main list, each individual feedback must be approved by an administrator.
To access the admin console, navigate to the "/supersecretpagethatnoonewilleverfind" path in the browser page running the app in development mode.
Click the thumbs up icon to approve, the thumbs down icon is disapprove, and the X icon to delete a feedback.

This does not use authenication of any kind and is NOT secure. It is not intended for production use and should only be left in place for development purposes.
