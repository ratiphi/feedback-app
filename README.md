# Getting Started with Feedback App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run server`

Runs the JSON-Server mock backend. This is requred for the frontend to work properly. Run this command in a separate terminal window.

### `npm run dev`

Runs both the 'npm start' and 'npm run server' commands together using the Concurrently package. Use this if you want to run the frontend and mock backend together in one terminal window.

## Admin Console

Before submitted feedback will be displayed in the main list, each individual feedback must be approved by an administrator.
To access the admin console, navigate to the "/supersecretpagethatnoonewilleverfind" path in the browser page running the app in development mode.
Click the thumbs up icon to approve, the thumbs down icon is disapprove, and the X icon to delete a feedback.

This does not use authenication of any kind and is NOT secure. It is not intended for production use and should only be left in place for development purposes.
